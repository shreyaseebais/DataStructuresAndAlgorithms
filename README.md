1. ### What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a specialized way of organizing, managing, and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

**Types of Data Structures**
1. Linear Data Structures: Data is arranged sequentially.
* Array: Collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
* Linked List: Elements (nodes) are connected using pointers.
* Stack: Follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
* Queue: Follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

2. Non-Linear Data Structures: Data is arranged hierarchically or graphically.
* Tree: Hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes (e.g., binary tree).
* Graph: Collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
* Heap: Specialized tree-based data structure.

3. Hash-Based Structures:
* Hash Table/Map: Stores key-value pairs for quick lookups.

4. Other Advanced Structures:
* Trie: Used for efficient string searching.
* Disjoint Set (Union-Find): Used for dynamic connectivity problems

2. ### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It takes input, processes it, and produces output.

**Characteristics of a Good Algorithm**
* Correctness: Produces the right result for all valid inputs.
* Efficiency: Minimizes the use of computational resources (time and space).
* Clarity: Easy to understand and implement.
* Scalability: Performs well as the size of the input increases.

112. ### Write a program for Decimal to Binary Conversion

Given a decimal number as input, we need to write a program to convert the given decimal number into an equivalent binary  number.

Brute force Approach
For Example: 
If the decimal number is 10. 
Step 1: Remainder when 10 is divided by 2 is zero. Therefore, arr[0] = 0. 
Step 2: Divide 10 by 2. New number is 10/2 = 5. 
Step 3: Remainder when 5 is divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, arr[1] = 1. 
Step 4: Divide 5 by 2. New number is 5/2 = 2. 
Step 5: Remainder when 2 is divided by 2 is zero. Therefore, arr[2] = 0. 
Step 6: Divide 2 by 2. New number is 2/2 = 1. 
Step 7: Remainder when 1 is divided by 2 is 1. Therefore, arr[3] = 1. 
Step 8: Divide 1 by 2. New number is 1/2 = 0. 
Step 9: Since number becomes = 0. Print the array in reverse order. Therefore the equivalent binary number is 1010.

We will use the distance formula derived from Pythagorean theorem. The formula for distance between two point (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is
Distance = sqrt{(x2-x1)^{2} + (y2-y1)^{2}}

```javascript
    function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow((x2 - x1), 2) + Math.pow((y2 - y1), 2));
    }
    console.log(distance(3, 4, 4, 3));

114. ### Program for Armstrong Numbers
Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong’s number or not.

A positive integer of n digits is called an Armstrong number of order n (order is the number of digits) if

abcd... = pow(a,n) + pow(b,n) + pow(c,n) + pow(d,n) + .... 

Eg. 

Input:153
Output: Yes
153 is an Armstrong number.
1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3 = 153


Input: 120
Output: No
120 is not a Armstrong number.
1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 0*0*0 = 9

Given an array of size N. The task is to find the maximum and the minimum element of the array using the minimum number of comparisons.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 1, 9}
Output: Minimum element is: 1
              Maximum element is: 9


Input: arr[] = {22, 14, 8, 17, 35, 3}
Output:  Minimum element is: 3
              Maximum element is: 35

        arr.forEach((el)=>
            {
                if(el<minimum)  minimum=el
            }
        );
        return minimum
    }

    function findMaxi(arr){
        let maximum = arr[0];
        arr.forEach((el)=>
            {
                if(el>maximum)  maximum=el
            }
        );

116. ### Array Reverse 
Given a fraction, find a recurring sequence of digits if it exists, otherwise, print “No recurring sequence”.

Given an array arr[], the task is to reverse the array. Reversing an array means rearranging the elements such that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes second last and so on.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5}  
Output: {5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1}
Explanation: The first element 1 moves to last position, the second element 4 moves to second-last and so on.


Input: arr[] = {4, 5, 1, 2} 
Output: {2, 1, 5, 4}
Explanation: The first element 4 moves to last position, the second element 5 moves to second last and so on.

```javascript
    let inputArr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5];
    console.log(reverseArray(inputArr));

    function reverseArray(arr){
        console.log(arr)
        let reversedArray=[];
        for(let i=arr.length-1; i>=0; i--){
            reversedArray.push(arr[i])
        }
        return reversedArray;
    }
```

117. ### Program to cyclically rotate an array by one
Given an array, the task is to cyclically rotate the array clockwise by one time. 

Examples:  


Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
Output: arr[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}


Input: arr[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 1}
Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Hint: Assign every element with its previous element and first element with the last element .
```javascript
    let inputArr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5];
    let numOfRotations = 1;
    console.log(rotateOnce(inputArr, numOfRotations));

    function rotateOnce(arr, rotations){
        console.log(arr)
        let rotatedArray=[];
        let numOfRotations = rotations;
        rotatedArray.push(arr[arr.length- numOfRotations])
        for(let i=0; i < (arr.length-numOfRotations); i++){
            rotatedArray.push(arr[i])
        }
        return rotatedArray;
    }
```

118. ### Array Sorting 
Sorting an array means arranging the elements of the array in a certain order. Generally sorting in an array is done to arrange the elements in increasing or decreasing order.

Problem statement: Given an array of integers arr, the task is to sort the array in ascending order and return it, without using any built-in functions.

Example:

Input: arr = [5, 2, 4, 3, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]


```javascript
    function sort(arr){
        console.log(arr);
        let sortedArray=[];
        for(let i=0; i<arr.length;i++){
            let swapped = false;
            for(let j=0;j<arr.length - i;j++){
                if(arr[j] > arr[j + 1]){
                    let temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true; 
                }
            }
            if (!swapped)
                break;
        }            
        return arr ;
    }

    console.log("Sorted array : ", sort([64,34, 91, 78,  22, 11, 90, 89]));

            for(let j=0; j<arr.length-i; j++){
                if(!dupes.includes(arr[i])){
                    if(arr[i]==arr[j]){
                        dupes.push(arr[i])
                        break;
                    }

122. ### Dutch National Flag Problem

*Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s*

Given an array arr[] consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. The task is to sort the array, i.e., put all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.

This problem is the same as the famous “Dutch National Flag problem”. The problem was proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The problem is as follows:

Given n balls of colour red, white or blue arranged in a line in random order. You have to arrange all the balls such that the balls with the same colours are adjacent with the order of the balls, with the order of the colours being red, white and blue (i.e., all red coloured balls come first then the white coloured balls and then the blue coloured balls). 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}
Output: {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2}
Explanation: {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2} has all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.


Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1}
Output: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}
Explanation: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2} has all 0s first, then all 1s and all 2s in last.
