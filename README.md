1. ### What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a specialized way of organizing, managing, and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

**Types of Data Structures**
1. Linear Data Structures: Data is arranged sequentially.
* Array: Collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
* Linked List: Elements (nodes) are connected using pointers.
* Stack: Follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
* Queue: Follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

2. Non-Linear Data Structures: Data is arranged hierarchically or graphically.
* Tree: Hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes (e.g., binary tree).
* Graph: Collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
* Heap: Specialized tree-based data structure.

3. Hash-Based Structures:
* Hash Table/Map: Stores key-value pairs for quick lookups.

4. Other Advanced Structures:
* Trie: Used for efficient string searching.
* Disjoint Set (Union-Find): Used for dynamic connectivity problems

2. ### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It takes input, processes it, and produces output.

**Characteristics of a Good Algorithm**
* Correctness: Produces the right result for all valid inputs.
* Efficiency: Minimizes the use of computational resources (time and space).
* Clarity: Easy to understand and implement.
* Scalability: Performs well as the size of the input increases.

101. ### Check Even or Odd
```javascript
const input = 11
console.log("Is the number even ?", isEvenOrOdd(input))

function isEvenOrOdd(num){
    console.log(num)
    if(num %2 == 0 ){
        return "Even"
    }else{
        return "Odd"
    }
}
```

        console.log("Numbers before : ",  i , "  " , j)
        let temp = 0;
        temp = i;
        i = j;
        j = temp;
